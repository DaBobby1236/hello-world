This is a tutorial I am taking to learn to set up a repository(repositories store information on a project.

  Making my username on Github was ridiculous.  Usually I just have a username as Da_Bob it was pretty annoying not being able to use underscores.  I ended up naming myself DaBobby1236.  That seems a bit excessive.  All I want is to be a python and java programmer.  Is that to much to ask:(.
